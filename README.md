This repository is an official PyTorch implementation of the paper
[**『 Partial Network Cloning 』**](https://arxiv.org/abs/).
It conducts partial parametric ``cloning'' from a source network and then injects the cloned 
module to the target, without modifying
its  parameters..

### The code would be released soon...
